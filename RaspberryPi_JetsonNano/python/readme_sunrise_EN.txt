This file is to help you use this Demo.
Since our ink screens are getting more and more, it is not convenient for our maintenance, so all the ink screen programs are made into one project.
A brief description of the use of this project is here:

1. Basic information:
This routine is developed based on the Ubuntu 20.04 Server_20220718 system image
This routine is developed based on Sunrise X3 PI, routines are verified on Sunrise X3 PI;
This routine is verified using the e-paper Driver HAT module. You can check the corresponding test routine in the examples\ of the project.

2. Pin connection:
Pin connections can be viewed in \lib\epdconfig.py and will be repeated here:
EPD    =>    sunrise x3 pi (BCM)
VCC    ->    3.3
GND    ->    GND
DIN    ->    10(SPI0_MOSI)
CLK    ->    11(SPI0_SCK)
CS     ->    8(SPI0_CS0)
DC     ->    25
RST    ->    17
BUSY   ->    24

3.Installation library
The system has built-in libraries, so you do not need to install them

4. Basic use:
Since this project is a comprehensive project, you may need to read the following for use:
You can view the test program in the examples\ directory.
Please note which ink screen you purchased.
Example 1:
     If you purchased 5.83inch e-paper, then you should execute the command:
     Sudo python epd_5in83_test.py
Example 2:
     If you buy a 2.9inch e-paper (B), since the 2.9-inch Type B and Type C are common driver codes,
     Then you should execute the command:
     Sudo python epd_2in9bc_test.py
    
Note: For epd_1in54_V2_test.py and epd_2in13_V2_test.py, please note that the V2 logo is attached to the back of your screen.
